* Non-deterministic Wallet: (random wallets) A wallet where private keys are generated from random numbers.
* Deterministic Wallet: A wallet where addresses, private keys, and public keys can be traced back to their original seed words.
* Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet: An advanced type of deterministic wallet that contains keys derived in a tree structure.
